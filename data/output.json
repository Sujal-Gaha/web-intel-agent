        "No \u2013 based on the posts listed on the site, there isn\u2019t a blog entry that covers a \u201ccustom async handler\u201d (or any other pattern that would let you avoid using `try\u2026catch` blocks). The current archive shows posts about content coupling, reusable tables with Shadcn/TanStack, and a TypeScript full\u2011stack app with Vite/Express/Prisma, but nothing that specifically addresses async error handling or a helper that replaces `try\u2026catch`. If you\u2019re looking for that kind of pattern, you might need to search elsewhere or create your own helper.",
        "Based on the content you shared, the blog post is focused on setting up a reusable table component with Shadcn and TanStack Table. It covers:\n\n1. Creating a Vite\u2011React app  \n2. Installing and configuring Tailwind, Shadcn, and TanStack Table  \n3. Building the table component itself  \n4. An example usage\n\nThere is no mention of a separate article or section about a \u201ccustom async handler\u201d or any pattern that eliminates the need for `try\u2026catch` blocks. If you\u2019re looking for guidance on handling async operations without repetitive `try\u2026catch` statements, you might need to look elsewhere on the site or in other resources.",
        "Based on the content you shared, the site appears to be focused on React\u2011table components and a couple of blog posts about \u201cContent Coupling\u201d and \u201cBuild a TypeScript F\u2026\u201d. There\u2019s no indication that it hosts a dedicated article or guide on creating a custom async handler to avoid repetitive `try\u2011catch` blocks.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a pattern to centralize async error handling in a React/TypeScript project, you might consider:\n\n1. **Higher\u2011Order Components (HOCs)** or **Custom Hooks** that wrap async functions and handle errors internally.\n2. **Middleware\u2011style utilities** that take an async function and return a new function that automatically catches and logs errors.\n3. **Global error boundaries** for React components that catch rendering errors, though they don\u2019t cover async logic directly.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a quick example of a custom async wrapper, let me know and I can sketch one out for you!",
        "I\u2019ve looked through the posts that are listed on the site (e.g., *Content Coupling*, *Reusable Table with Shadcn and TanStack Table*, and the \u201cSetup Typescript\u2011powered full\u2011stack app with Vite, Express, Prisma\u201d guide). None of those articles discuss a custom async handler or a pattern that eliminates the need for `try\u2011catch` blocks.  \n\nSo, based on the current content that\u2019s publicly available, the site does **not** have a blog post that covers a custom async handler for avoiding `try\u2011catch` statements.

All of the tagged posts I saw are about setting up MERN stacks, TypeScript, Prisma, etc., and none of them cover a helper or wrapper for async functions.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a pattern to avoid writing `try\u2026catch` in every async route or function, you might want to look at:\n\n* **Express middleware** that catches rejected promises (e.g., `express-async-handler` or a custom wrapper that forwards errors to `next()`).\n* **Higher\u2011order functions** that wrap async callbacks and automatically handle errors.\n* **Utility libraries** like `pify` or `bluebird` that convert callbacks to promises and provide error handling.\n\nThose patterns are common in the Node/Express ecosystem, but they\u2019re not covered on this particular blog.
